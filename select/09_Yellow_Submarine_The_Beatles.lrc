[00:01.03] In the town where I was born
[00:04.98] Lived a man who sailed to sea
[00:09.58] And he told us of his life
[00:13.56] In the land of submarines
[00:17.89] So we sailed on to the sun
[00:21.84] 'Til we found a sea of green
[00:26.67] And we lived beneath the waves
[00:30.96] In our yellow submarine
[00:42.46] 
[00:35.55] We all live in a yellow submarine
[00:39.63] Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[00:44.25] We all live in a yellow submarine
[00:48.24] Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[01:05.24] 
[00:52.20] And our friends are all aboard
[00:56.26] Many more of them live next door
[01:00.97] And the band begins to play
[01:14.47] 
[01:09.92] We all live in a yellow submarine
[01:14.28] Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[01:18.65] We all live in a yellow submarine
[01:22.91] Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[01:39.91] 
[01:28.33] (Full steam ahead, Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
[01:34.31] Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant)
[01:37.07] (Cut the cable, drop the cable)
[01:40.40] (Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye)
[01:42.10] (Captain, captain)
[01:51.10] 
[01:44.79] As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
[01:48.53] Every one of us (every one of us)
[01:51.63] Has all we need (has all we need)
[01:53.19] Sky of blue (sky of blue)
[01:55.35] And sea of green (sea of green)
[01:57.65] In our yellow (in our yellow)
[01:59.30] Submarine (submarine, aha)
[02:12.30] 
[02:02.29] We all live in a yellow submarine
[02:06.63] A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[02:10.98] We all live in a yellow submarine
[02:14.96] A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[02:19.33] We all live in a yellow submarine
