There's a yellow rose in Texas
I'm going home to see
Though other men have held her
Her heart belongs to me.
You've traveled down some dusty roads
And slept out in the rain
But this yellow rose is always here when you come home again
She knows I've done some hard time
You've stumbled and you fell
I just kept your pride from dying
You saved my soul from hell
She's a diamond of the desert
She's a golden flower of spring
She's the yellow rose in Texas
She can make a man a king
There's a yellow rose in Texas
She knows the dues I've paid
And I'm going home to tell her
I wish I never strayed
You couldn't see beyond yourself
Your pain and wounded pride
But now you know the truth is in the way you feel inside
She knows I've done some hard time
You've stumbled and you fell
I just kept your pride from dying
You saved my soul from hell
She's a diamond of the desert
She's a golden flower of spring
She's the yellow rose in Texas
She can make a man a king
Yes the yellow rose of Texas
Can make a man a king.
