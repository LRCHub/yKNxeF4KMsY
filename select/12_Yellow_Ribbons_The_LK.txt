I used to crash into the snow
But now I know
The yellow mount of the standing wheel
Isn't real

So, hey, go be what you know
Get more, keep a steady flow
Don't go
You know I'd rather go
Through the skin and to the bone
To the bone

I still remember when I put up a fight
Still alright
The yellow ribbons of Tokyo and all we know
Versus the snow

So, hey, go be what you know
Say no, keep a steady flow
No, go, just do me slow
Through the skin and to the bone.
To the bone

October, no way
All the games we didn't have time to play
Long winter, go away
Play ahead and never give
Never give

November, no way
All the names we didn't have time to say
Long winter, go away
Put your head down and never get up
Never get up
